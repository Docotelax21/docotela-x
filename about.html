        <h1 class="about-title">The Story of Docotela X</h1>

        <p class="about-text">
            Docotela X was born from the pursuit of one feeling — <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. 
            A feeling shaped by struggle, failures, rebuilding, and the courage to choose a path that 
            few believed in.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
            Before the brand existed, there were countless attempts, ideas that crashed, products 
            designed and thrown away, and moments where nothing seemed to work. Investors said no, 
            people suggested taking the “safe” path, and the pressure to give up was loud. But the 
            vision stayed alive.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
            Docotela X became a reflection of life itself — the fight to stay true to your art, to 
            your identity, and to the freedom you dream of. Every collection is limited, handcrafted, 
            and created with intention. Ten artists, eight artists, sometimes only one — but always 
            authentic. Every piece carries energy, story, mistakes, triumphs, and pure creativity. 
        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
            The philosophy behind the brand was shaped by personal journeys: losing opportunities, 
            finding new ones, rebuilding, and proving consistency through projects like restoring a 
            1978 VW Beetle from a bare shell — a six-year testament to vision, patience, and 
            craftsmanship.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
            Docotela X is more than clothing. It's wearable art — a feeling you step into. 
            When a customer wears a piece, they wear the journey, the late nights, the silent growth, 
            the fight for greatness. They wear freedom.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text end">
            This is Docotela X.<br>
            A gallery of expression, scarcity, emotion, and art — built for those who feel deeply.
